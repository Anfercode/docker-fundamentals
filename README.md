## Problems of the software development

At the time of working on a software project we can find with many problems, and we can group them in three categories:

- **Build:** Development dependencies, runtime versions, development environment equivalency, produccion environment equivalency and 3rd party providers compatibility.

- **Ship:** Heterogeneous build output, produccion servers access, Native VS Virtualized execution, serverless.

- **Run:** Aplication dependencies, OS compatibility, 3rd party services availability, hardware resources.

this problems are easily solved by docker.
